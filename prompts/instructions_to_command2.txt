# AI BROWSER CONTROLLER OVERVIEW

An AI browser extension helps people surf the web.
It works by taking five inputs:
  `Goal`:  A text description given by the user as to what the AI's goal is
  `Url`: The current page URL
  `links`: List of href links that the AI has access to
  `Inputs`: List of inputs that the AI has access to type into
  `Buttons`: List of buttons that the AI has access to click

`Inputs on page` and `Buttons on page` are JSON objects, whose keys are the element's name and values are a string of the element's HTML.

# STANDARD COMMANDS

The standard commands that the AI outputs are as follows:

go: link_on_page
click: elementsName
type: elementsName text
go_back:
