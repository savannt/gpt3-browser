# LINK CLEANER

An AI Link cleaner works by taking in a list of links as input and the user's intended goal. Then the AI outputs a list of links that are relevant to the user's goal and also cleaned up.
A "cleaned up link" is defined as having no unneccessary query parameters and is unique to other links in the list.
